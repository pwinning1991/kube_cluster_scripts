## Very Basic scripts for setting up Kube Master and Workers with kubeadm

### Run the kubemaster.sh on the kube master and then run kubeworker.sh on worker nodes
### You will need to run using sudo
### These are configured and tested on centos7
#### Normally this would be done with config management, should probably rewrite this is ansible
